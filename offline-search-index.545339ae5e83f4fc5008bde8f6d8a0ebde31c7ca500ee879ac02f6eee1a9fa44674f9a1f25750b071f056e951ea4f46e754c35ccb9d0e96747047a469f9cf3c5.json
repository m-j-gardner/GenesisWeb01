[{"body":"Case Study Account Team Scene Setting You have recently joined a client team as a Platform Engineer.\nThe existing leadership team on an account includes the Account Executive (James) and the Account Chief Architect (Sarah).\nThe client is a large global automotive manufacturing firm with a large wide-ranging IT estate including mainframes, factory systems, private cloud as well as public cloud capabilities. Capgemini currently provide Application management services for the Manufacturing but have also recently won the service provision for Hosting services, Cloud and some aspects of Digital development.\nClient Scene Setting ABC Automotive has just defined a new Information \u0026amp; Technology strategy to move the organisation into the digital age. Ben, the CTO is keen to explore how he can respond to the company’s 3 priorities:\n Digital transformation Electrification Customer Centricity  Furthermore, in giving Capgemini the large contract, it has just won, he is keen to see a real shift in dial with regards to agility and pace of delivery to aid the strategic objectives above. He is keen to get:\n More agility for the technology platforms to support digital Reduction in outages being experienced by digital Audit compliance in the digital space Eradication of security breaches and non-compliant platforms being used by digital  Client Profile ABC Automotive was formed since the 1920s and has a strong heritage in car and truck production globally as a leading brand. ABC Automotive it is broadly divided into the following divisions; Manufacturing \u0026amp; Logistics, Enterprise, Product Creation, Commercial, Financial Planning, Corporate, Platforms, People Experience \u0026amp; Finance, Enterprise Digital.\nIT Operating Model ABC Automotive is just rolling out a new business and IT operating model covering the retained organisation aiming to focus on building re-usable platforms to enable faster and more affordable business initiatives. Taking on a Product focus and building on platforms, they are aiming to introduce agility and close the current gap between IT and the rest of the business.\nThe IT Transformation unit is tasked with delivering all strategic transformation change and includes the programme delivery and management organisation.\nCurrently, delivery is mostly driven via a waterfall lifecycle approach, though agile and DevOps are models that the customer is increasingly looking to utilise.\nEnterprise Digital Enterprise digital has already adopted the agile and digital ways of working. Over the past 3 years they have built multiple System of Engagement applications and microservices on AWS using Java / Spring. They also utilise the Atlassian suite for their development quite heavily.\nMost of these are net new applications based on emerging requirements rather than replacement of existing functionality. However, there is now a strategy to replace some of the aging application estate currently Mainframe based.\nSusan is keen to embrace containerisation as part of this strategic requirement for Mainframe transformation however is unclear as to how best to approach this due to the myriad of options available in the cloud market space.\nThe AWS land scape used by Enterprise Digital has not been structured as each digital squad have just created their own accounts, thus the environment has evolved resulting in quite a large support team across all the squads providing support and operational capabilities for patching backup and recovery etc with no standards. Security is also a challenge as a recent audit showed that they were non-compliant on patching for a lot of their Linux and Windows server instances as well as had some application code security vulnerabilities. In addition, they seem to have varying variants and versions of Linux in the environment.\nHosting Estate Within IT there was a wide range of infrastructure in use. Though most of the infrastructure is on premise, there is now a strategic shift to Cloud being driven by Ben, thus an expectation of migration of on-premise infrastructure to Cloud. The Cloud strategy is a multi-cloud one which will leverage both AWS and Azure as required. There is also a strategic drive to work closer with the Enterprise Digital teams enabling closer integration, standardisation, and transparency. Currently the service operations teams have very little knowledge of what goes on within the Enterprise Digital space and do not get visibility of any releases, roll back or technical changes until there are IT failures or outages. IT Operations utilise ServiceNow as their selected ITSM tool, but this is not used by the Enterprise Digital who have their own toolchains supporting their development pipeline as such do not report any feedback to the IT operations teams.\nThere current infrastructure landscape includes the following:\nData Centres\n DC1 – Owned – Uptime Institute Tier 3 certified DC2 – Owned – Uptime Institute Tier 3 certified 8 Factory based DCs across the Globe Infrastructure (On Premise) Windows servers, circa 4000 Linux, circa 3000 IBM As400, 10 Fujitsu Mainframe, 4 OpenVMS - 45 Microsoft SQL Server Database Instances, 600  Public Cloud\n Azure Server VMs - 2400 AWS Server instances, circa 850 (currently managed by Digital) MariaDB, 18  ","excerpt":"Case Study Account Team Scene Setting You have recently joined a client team as a Platform Engineer. …","ref":"/docs/skills-tracks/engineer/case-study/","title":"Case Study"},{"body":"Overview  6 week facilitated program, delivered as 4 x 1 week sprints and 1 x 2 week sprint Focuses on some core cloud competencies Introduces OpenShift platform Achieve vendor accreditation Show + tell for graduation  Pre-requisits You will need to have an understanding of cloud technologies including: Compute, IaaS, PaaS, Network, Storage, Security essentials, etc. You will need an understanding of code scripting.\nObjectives \u0026amp; Key Results Enable our Customers to build \u0026amp; operate platforms in hybrid cloud environments.\nSkills  OpenShift Administration Agile practice, Infrastructure as Code, Cloud Providers, Container Platforms  Certification  RedHat OpenShift 4 Administration Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900); or AWS SysOps admin; or Google Associate Cloud Engineer  Track outline Refresh - Week 1  Team Introduction Course overview Agile Coach  Overview Daily Standups Retrospective    Focuses:\n  Agility - Agile at Capgemini: Awareness, Frameworks, Roles, Leadership\n Agile Foundation My Passport to Agile from Capgemini.
